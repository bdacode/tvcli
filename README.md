This was my first attempt at learning Python. I set the target of creating a simple command line script to retrieve info about the user's favourite TV programs and outputting schedules/information about them.

# Features
* Keep a list of all your favourite TV programs.
* See which programs are airing today, tomorrow, or a certain number of days in the future.
* Easily search for a program in the TVDB and add it.
* Update the list of programs at any time using data from the TVDB.

# Requirements
The only required non-standard Python library is [colorama](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama).
